Growraf
=======

Growraf (pronounced grow-rough) is a plugin for [flot charts](http://www.flotcharts.org), that produces smooth animations using requestAnimationFrame wherever possible.

Its a fork of the [Growing](https://github.com/jumjum123/JUMFlot) plugin for flot, from JÃ¼rgen Marsch.

The API is the same with Growing plugin except from the steps & stepDelay combination.
There is a new option named "duration" (in ms) that simplifies the rAF implementation and provides greater control.
