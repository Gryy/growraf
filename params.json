{"name":"Growraf","tagline":"A plugin for jquery.flot for smooth animations using requestAnimationFrame","body":"Growraf\r\n=======\r\n\r\nGrowraf (pronounced grow-rough) is a plugin for [flot charts](http://www.flotcharts.org), that produces smooth animations using requestAnimationFrame wherever possible.\r\n\r\nIts a fork of the [Growing](https://github.com/jumjum123/JUMFlot) plugin for flot, from JÃ¼rgen Marsch.\r\n\r\nThe API is the same with Growing plugin except from the steps & stepDelay combination.\r\nThere is a new option named \"duration\" (in ms) that simplifies the rAF implementation and provides greater control.\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n--------\r\n[Growraf example](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/thgreasi/growraf/blob/master/examples/growraf.html) in comparison with [Growing minor bugs](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/thgreasi/growraf/blob/master/examples/growbugs.html)\r\n\r\n[Growraf + Resize example](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/thgreasi/growraf/blob/master/examples/growrafresize.html) in comparison with [Growing + Resize bug](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/thgreasi/growraf/blob/master/examples/resizegrowbug.html)\r\n\r\n[Growraf heavy data plots](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/thgreasi/growraf/blob/master/examples/heavyplot_growraf.html) in comparison with [Grow heavy data plots](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/thgreasi/growraf/blob/master/examples/heavyplot_grow.html) *note the time increase with more data/plots*\r\n\r\nExtras\r\n------\r\nAdded a 'growFinished' event that is triggered on the plot's placeholder.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar $placeholder = $('#placeholder');\r\n$placeholder.on('growFinished', function () {\r\n   alert('Grow Animation Finished');\r\n});\r\n\r\n$.plot($placeholder, [{\r\n        label: \"linear\",\r\n        data: [[1,1], [2,2], /*...,*/ [10,10]],\r\n        grow: { growings:[ { stepMode: \"maximum\" } ] }\r\n    }], {\r\n        series: { grow: { active: true } }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrequently Asked\r\n----------------\r\n*   **Does it work on browsers not supporting requestAnimationFrame?**\r\n\r\n    **Yes**, Growraf checks if the current browser supports requestAnimationFrame (prefixed or not) and (if there is no support) fallbacks to setTimeout.\r\n\r\n    Some of the browsers that the setTimeout polyfill is used include:\r\n    *   IE <= 8\r\n    *   Safari <= 5.1\r\n    *   Opera (12.1 as of writing this)\r\n    *   Firefox < 4.0\r\n    *   Chrome < 10.0\r\n\r\n    sources: [caniuse](http://caniuse.com/#search=requestAnimationFrame) and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.requestAnimationFrame)\r\n\r\n    notes:\r\n    *   Based on [paulirish's gist](https://gist.github.com/paulirish/1579671) for the setTimeout polyfill.\r\n    *   Does not polyfill requestAnimationFrame for the rest of page, just for growraf.\r\n\r\n\r\n*   **Does it work in oldIE?**\r\n\r\n    **Yes**, as long as exCanvas is provided, it should work.\r\n\r\n    **BUT** instead of delivering a choppy animation, I strongly suggest you to disable animations for those browsers by checking if window.G_vmlCanvasManager is defined and setting the series.grow.active property to false.\r\n","google":"UA-40765812-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
